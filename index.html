        <h2>Statistic</h2>
        <p>It’s been shown that high levels of carbon dioxide can have impact on one’s productivity as well as increase the risk of developing sickness, therefore the presence of carbon dioxide in our homes, offices and schools as well as public places is a major health concern that needs to be corrected. There has also been studies done on how the CO2 levels can cause weakened learning abilities and make it more difficult to complete both simple and complex tasks, which is crucial for environments focused on this. 
        <br><br>
        The safe levels of CO2 are:
        <br>400 ppm – The outdoors fresh air contains 400 ppm of CO2.
        <br>1000 ppm – The indoors however is ideal whenever its below 1000 ppm
        <br>1500 ppm – If the CO2 levels indoors go above 1500 ppm, necessary steps should be taken to decrease the amount.
        <br>2000 ppm – The serious symptoms of high-level exposure to CO2 start to show up at levels above 2000 ppm. 
        <br><br>
